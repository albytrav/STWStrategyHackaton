Welcome to the STWStrategy hackathon wiki! In this wiki you can reproduce the hackathon that we had on 2019/11/28. This hackathon is part of the projects STW Strategy 1.1/1.2/2.1/2.2. The goals of the hackathon were:

1. Test run of WORC including: data download from XNAT, extraction of radiomics features, simple prediction of target variables, storage and visualization of results
2. Integrating in WORC the different radiomics toolboxes developed within the projects
3. Learn how to run SEDI and produce RDF triples from DICOM headers
4. Learn how to produce radiomics RDF triples using the Radiomics Ontology

Please see the Wiki for more details.
